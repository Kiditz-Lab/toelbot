# Shopify Setup

If you are integrating Shopify into our app (for example, to fetch products, customers, and orders), you will typically create a **Custom App** inside Shopify.

## Creating a Custom App

Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Login to Shopify Admin**
   - Go to your storeâ€™s admin dashboard.

2. **Navigate to Apps and Sales Channels**
   - Click on **Settings** â†’ **Apps and sales channels**.

3. **Enable App Development**
   - Click **Develop apps**.
   - If required, enable **App Development** (Shopify may ask for confirmation).

4. **Create Your App**
   - Click **Create an app**.
   - Enter a name for your app, e.g., **Shopify MCP Server**.
   - Choose a developer or yourself as the app owner.

5. **Configure Admin API Scopes**
   - Click **Configure Admin API scopes**.
   - Select these scopes:
     - `read_products`
     - `write_products`
     - `read_customers`
     - `write_customers`
     - `read_orders`
     - `write_orders`

6. **Save Settings**
   - After selecting the scopes, click **Save**.

7. **Install the App**
   - Click **Install app**.
   - Confirm by clicking **Install** when prompted.

8. **Get API Credentials**
   - After the app is installed, youâ€™ll find your **Admin API access token**.
   - **Important**: Copy and securely store the **Admin API access token** â€” you won't be able to see it again later.
