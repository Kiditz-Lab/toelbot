# Toelbot Features

### 1. Conversational Lead Generation
- **Overview**: Automates the collection of lead information via chat on **web live chat, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, Slack, or other chat channels**.
- **How it Works**: 
  - When a user engages with your business on any of these platforms, **Toelbot** asks for their **name, email, and phone number**.
  - The collected information is then saved into your **CRM/database** for follow-up.
  - Customizable questions based on your business needs (e.g., “What service are you interested in?”).

**Additional Idea**:  
- **Multi-Step Conversations**: Allow users to provide more than just basic information by asking follow-up questions based on user responses (e.g., "What type of service are you looking for?" or "Which product are you interested in?").

---

### 2. Simple Lead Generation via Forms
- **Overview**: Use a **simple form in chat** to capture Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- **How it Works**: 
  - The user is presented with a straightforward form that asks for key information like **name, email, phone number**, etc.
  - Can be triggered by a specific action (e.g., a “Sign-up” button or a request for more information).
  - Once completed, the data is sent to your CRM or stored in your database for easy follow-up.

**Additional Idea**:  
- **Customizable Forms**: Create different forms based on use cases (e.g., a “Free Consultation” form, “Product Inquiry” form, etc.), making it flexible for various types of business needs.

---

### 3. Simple Workflow Automation
- **Overview**: Automates simple workflows for businesses that want quick responses and actions after specific triggers.
- **How it Works**: 
  - When a user requests an **appointment** via chat, **Toelbot** sends a notification to a **Slack, Discord, or WhatsApp group** to alert the team.
  - Sends a **post message to the user** confirming their appointment.
  - Provides **preset prompt lists** that users can easily replace with their own details (e.g., "Confirm your appointment with a simple message like: 'I'll attend the 3 PM slot'").

**Additional Idea**:  
- **Appointment Rescheduling/Reminders**: Once an appointment is set, you can offer automated reminders (via WhatsApp/Slack/Email) and enable users to easily reschedule or cancel their appointments through simple chat commands.

---

### 4. Lead Qualification via Chat
- **Overview**: Automatically qualify leads through conversational AI, helping to identify hot prospects early.
- **How it Works**:
  - After gathering basic contact info, **Toelbot** can ask a few qualifying questions (e.g., budget, timeline, or product preferences).
  - Leads are automatically segmented into categories (e.g., “High Priority,” “Medium Priority,” “Low Priority”) based on their responses.
  - This data can be sent to your CRM to streamline the follow-up process.

**Additional Idea**:  
- **Lead Scoring**: Assign lead scores based on their responses. For example, if a user mentions a large budget or tight timeline, their score could be higher, indicating they're a more valuable lead.

---

### 5. Customizable Chatbots for FAQ Automation
- **Overview**: Automate answers to frequently asked questions using **Toelbot's pre-configured FAQ system**.
- **How it Works**:
  - Businesses can upload common FAQs into **Toelbot**, which will automatically answer user questions in real-time.
  - Examples include questions about business hours, services offered, pricing, etc.
  - Can be used across multiple channels such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Slack, and web chat.

**Additional Idea**:  
- **Dynamic FAQ Updates**: Enable the system to learn new questions and answers over time, allowing it to automatically update the FAQ without manual intervention.

---

### 6. Data Analytics and Reporting
- **Overview**: Collect and analyze data from **all conversations** to track performance and engagement.
- **How it Works**:
  - Toelbot logs interactions and stores data about user behavior, such as which prompts were clicked most, response rates, etc.
  - Provides businesses with actionable insights into lead generation performance and engagement trends.
  - Can also track conversion rates (e.g., how many leads filled out the form or booked an appointment).

**Additional Idea**:  
- **Conversion Funnel Tracking**: Visualize the lead journey from initial interaction to conversion (e.g., form submission or appointment booking) to identify where most leads drop off, allowing for improvement in your workflow.

---

### 7. Integration with Existing Tools
- **Overview**: Seamlessly integrates with popular **CRM, email marketing tools, and other business tools**.
- **How it Works**:
  - Automatically sync collected data (name, email, phone, etc.) with your CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce).
  - Trigger actions in other tools (e.g., sending a follow-up email after a lead submits a form).
  - Ability to automate workflows with tools like Zapier or n8n for even more advanced automation.
